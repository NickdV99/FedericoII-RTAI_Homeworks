# RTAI_Homeworks
Homeworks performed for the Real-Time Systems course taught by professor Marcello Cinque at the University of Naples Federico II.
- The first of one is about Kernel programming using RTAI(Real-Time Application Interface).
- The second homework is about the development of an ABS and Air-Bag system, so the simulation of a sudden stop in a car. 
  It is also done in C with RTAI, and it is an example of a real-time code both in Kernel and User mode.
